# Big Data for Cities - Fall 2017

## Important links, info, and documents

[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ExwtJAuy5prxz5vwfYboIybRVd7JXVOzVDsbiOGpyyU/edit?usp=sharing)

Textbook - [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

Instructions for installing R and Rstudio can be found in the `installing_r/` directory.

It is highly recommended, but absolutely not required, that you both setup a github profile and [learn some very simple git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) commands. This will help build a place where you can host your work and strengthen your resume should you be interested in going into data science/analytics.

### Getting help
Connor McKay - c.mckay@northeastern.edu

Curt Savoie - c.savoie@northeastern.edu

[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) for programming help

[r-documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/) for online docs

`?package_name` or `?function_name` within R sessions for in-R docs

### Homework
All homework notebooks will be "handed out" here, they can be found in the `homework/` directory. Each homework assignment will be an [R notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) where you will have spaces where you will need to enter R code to run and/or text describing your process. These notebooks are subject to change up to a week prior to being due.

Homework will help ensure you build the skills you need to complete your final project. They are meant to lightly reinforce the coding examples you will see in each week's class as well as within each week's reading.

### Cheatsheets

[Data Transformation (dplyr)](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-transformation-cheatsheet.pdf)

[R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)

[Data Viz](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf)

[Rstudio General](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf)

### Reading
The course textbook is (the online, free, and excellent) [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickam.

Each week you may have one or more passages from this book to read. This text is meant to show you the thought process behind programming concepts that will be key to analyzing the data assigned and completing the final. This book also comes with many in-line and simple examples of R code you can run yourself to gain a better intuition around what you are learning. It also contains a great number of exercises which are highly recommended, especially if you are finding the programming for a given week particularly challenging.
