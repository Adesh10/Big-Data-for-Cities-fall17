## The basics

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.


Notebooks make it easy to explore our data and present it to end consumers all in one user-friendly package. We can view tibbles and dataframes in many ways:
```{r} 
cars
iris
head(cars)
tail(cars)  # not really all that useful...
```

In R we are mostly concerned with manipulating `data.frames` and `tibbles` two data types for tabular data where the columns can be different data types (numeric, character, logical).


Base R provides a number of ways to get a handle on some data we have to work with:
```{r}
summary(cars)

x <- tibble::tibble(cars$speed)

iris
summary(iris)
```

Looking at just one column of a data frame can be done with the `$` operator
```{r}
iris$Species
iris$Sepal.Length
```

## R data types
R has a number of data types available to you as a programmer. Of significant importance for this course are: `numeric`, `boolean`, `factor`, `character` and `date`. 

### numeric data
working with simple numeric data in R is tantamount to using a very flexible calculator.
```{r}
2 + 2
10 * 5
50 / 2

2 ** 4

(10 - 20) * 5
```

Things get interesting when we start working with variables. Variables allow us to "save" the value of something and even change it over time. They help us keep track of things as we're programming and are a vital tool.

Variable _assignment_ in R is handled with the `<-` operator, this is one of R's many, many peculiarities as most programming languages leave this to the sensibly selected `=`. 

```{r}
x <- 4
x

x + 2
x

y <- x + 2
y
```

You can assign a lot more than just numbers to variables.

### Boolean
Boolean data is a fancy name for data which takes one of two values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`. A helpful thing to know is that R (and some other programming languages too) will represent True as a 1 and a False as a 0 allowing things like:

```{r}
TRUE * 5 
FALSE * 5
FALSE + 1
```

Boolean data and logic is important for filtering and subsetting data in R because equality statements ultimately evaluate to boolean data, but more on that later. 
```{r}
x <- 0

x == 0

x < 0

x == "apples"
x != "apples"
```

The `&` operator acts as "and" and the `|` operator acts as "or". 
```{r}
FALSE | TRUE
FALSE & TRUE

TRUE | TRUE
FALSE | FALSE

FALSE & FALSE
TRUE & TRUE

# you can use just the first letter for short

T | T
```

### Factor
Factors in R represent categorical data, or data which exist in a finite set of categories or levels. A good example is a column indicating which neighborhood a 311 complaint belongs to. We will see more about factors as we learn about vectors and other containers for our data. 

```{r}
x <- as.factor(c("Allston", "Boston"))
x
```

### Character
Character data is textual data which does not fall into a finite set of categories, such as free text descriptions, names, etc.

```{r}
y <- c("This is some character data", "this is also character")

y
```
Notice the lack of information on the levels. 

### Date
Dates are notoriously difficult, in any programming language. [Timezones](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/supervillain_plan_2x.png) are another story themselves. Fortunately we have a wonderful package `lubridate` which takes a lot of the headache out of working with dates in R. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

# parsing dates
ymd("10/10/10")  # year month day
mdy("10/10/10")

ymd_hms("10/10/10 12:00:00")
ymd_hm("2017-05-10 12:00")

# and so on...
```

You can view [docs on lubridate here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/lubridate.pdf)

### Functions
Functions are not data per se but they are crucial for understanding containers for data like vectors and dataframes, especially the creation and manipulation of these objects. 

One of the most simple functions in R is the `c()` or concatenate function. All functions in R follow the `function_name()` syntax. We place "arguments" within the parentheses `()` in order to generate output. Like in mathematics, functions return values given some input. We can assign these outputs to variables with the `<-` operator

```{r}
# concatenate allows us to stick items together
nhoods <- c("allston", "east boston", "downtown")
nhoods

square_it <- function(int) {
  return_val = int ** 2
  return(return_val)
}

square_it(2)

c("dorchester", nhoods)

c(1:10, 11, 42)
```

### Vectors
We often want to work with more than one instance of a thing and keeping track of hundreds or thousands of variables would be nearly impossible. For this we have vectors. Vectors allow us to stick many instances of some data into a single thing represented by a single variable name.

```{r}
shopping_list <-c("milk", "bread", "cheese", "apples")

shopping_list
```

There are many conveinient ways to create longer vectors that does not require manual work

```{r}
list_of_numbers <- 0:100
list_of_numbers

long_shopping_list <- c(rep("milk", 4) , "bread", rep("cheese", 2), "apples")
long_shopping_list

date_vector <- seq(ymd("2011-12-30"),ymd("2012-01-10"), by = "days")
date_vector

c(rep(T, 5), rep(F, 10))
```

```{r}
iris

summary(iris)

mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
min(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

x <- readr::read_csv('https://data.boston.gov/dataset/8048697b-ad64-4bfc-b090-ee00169f2323/resource/2968e2c0-d479-49ba-a884-4ef523ada3c0/download/311.csv', progress = F)


plt <- ggplot(x, aes(x = floor_date(open_dt, "day"))) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("311 Cases by Day") +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Date Created") +
  ylab("Count of Cases")

plotly::ggplotly(plt)
```


## Saving
When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
